Pay-plans allow you to check the forecast for your individual expenses, a category (loans or subscriptions) or fir your whole account. It allows you to easily check how much money you owe, and how much you will have to pay on each upcoming month, combining your subscribed services and your debts.

Pairing this with the timemachine feature lets you easily check your plan and when its the right time for you to activate a subscription or ask for a loan. Timemachine is the little month selector you can find in the upper bar since alpha 0.3.0:

Hovering your mouse, you can see at a glance which of the subscriptions or loans start/ends, or you have something shared.

Additionally, you can see an isolated plan for an specific loan just by visiting its profile, to better understand how much you are paying and until when. Now its easier than ever to acknowledge your debts and plan your future.
