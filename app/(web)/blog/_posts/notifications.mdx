Today we are adding notification to **Expentrac** along with the launch of the alpha 0.2.0. You will see **a red dot on your avatar and receive an email** when you have a new notification such as a friend trying to share a fee with you, the same friend accepting to share or your daily update regarding your expenses.

Hope you enjoy these new features!
